# Windows to MAC pain transition

## Tips & Tricks

### Drag and Drop files

 - Drag it -> `CMD + TAB` -> Drop it

### File preview

 - Press `spacebar` 

### Open downloaded apps

Usually when you try to open a downloaded application, you will get a pop-up saying that the developer cannot be verified. This is solved by opening it once or twice with a two-finger click or right-click.

### Install apps

 - Applications are usually installed by moving the `.app` to the Applications folder 
 
### Uninstall apps

 - Move it from Applications folder to Trash, that's all

### Appstore apps

All apps distributed through the Mac App Store are sandboxed (it's a requirement). Sandboxing severely limits what an app can do on your Mac. This is usually a good thing as it helps prevent malware and viruses from taking over your Mac or stealing your information.

Unfortunately, sandboxing also means that certain actions/tasks can't be completed by the sandboxed app. Getting a list of every app and process running on your Mac is something a sandboxed app can't do.

### Keep in mind

 - Apple silicon macs are ARM based, which means x86 apps will run under Rosetta 2 emulation.

### macbook restart or shutdown

 - Wait a bit before upgrade, save yourself the headache and wait until your apps are ready for the new version
